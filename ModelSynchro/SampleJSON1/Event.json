  "description": "Same story, different era. Alexis Coe, The Wing's in-house historian, thinks the Salem witch trials weren't just about fear of the occult or a community's revenge on an individual: It was about the patriarchy's attempts to punish women's subversion of male authority in the New World, often through violent, hysterical, public spectacles. Come for lurid tales of demonic possession and a frighteningly familiar glance at fragile manhood, colonial era style. See you at the witching hour of 7pm.\n",
